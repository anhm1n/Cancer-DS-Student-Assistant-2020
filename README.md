# Cancer Data Science Student Assistant
## What is this?
This project folder serves to show examples of some of the code I wrote while I was a Data Science Student Assistant under Emisa Nategh, a PhD Candidate in the Information Systems & Operations Management Department (2019-2020). I have omitted most, if not all, examples of my data cleaning/manipulation to be discrete.

## What did I contribute?
I created data visualizations and did a majority of the coding in the summer of 2020. I provided statistical perspective and techniques I learned from school such as Box Cox Transformations and VIF. I gave input in terms of direction of the research and made necessary adjustments to the data. I also found another team member and provided orientation and some training. Towards the end, I had an exciting project in which I ran several statistical models and then created a Shiny interface.

## What did I learn?
Communication, I learned about communication. I learned that asking specific questions only, usually as a last resort, helped me and my research lead work on the same page. It did not hurt to ask questions because it let me produce better work while catching errors in instructions or discrepancies in the data, but I learned how to be autonomous and use the Internet and my school training to supplement when I did not know things. I learned a variety of new statistical/machine learning techniques while learning more about the details of data concerning cancer and cancer patients.
