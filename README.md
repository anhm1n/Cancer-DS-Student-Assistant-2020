## What is this?
This project folder serves to show examples of some of the code I wrote while I was a Data Science Student Assistant. I have omitted most, if not all, examples of my data cleaning/manipulation to be discrete.

## What did I learn?
Communication, I learned about communication. I learned that asking specific questions helped me and my research lead work on the same page. It did not hurt to ask questions because it let me create better work while catching errors in instructions or discrepancies in the data.
